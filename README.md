# MMD Wasserstein gradient flow on the line
Implicit and explicit Euler schemes for Wasserstein gradient flow of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with respect to the negative distance kernel on the line.

This repository contains three files for recreating the figures in the preprint ...

1. ```implicit_with_Dirac_at_zero_target``` recreates figure ..., illustrating the implicit Euler discretization of the MMD flow whose target is the Dirac measure at 0.
2. ```discrete_Target``` recreates figures ... and ... and implements the explicit formula for the quantile functions of the MMD flow with discrete target measure.
3. ```Euler_schemes``` recreates all other figures.
